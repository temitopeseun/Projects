# Projects
Compilation of "Data Science Projects in the last months" 


.Project #1:  This project involves [Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA], Data Visualization, and Visual Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/temitopeseun/Projects/tree/main/Project_01).

.Project #2:  This project involves "[EDA, and solving classification problems using Machine Learning (ML)](https://github.com/temitopeseun/Projects/tree/main/Project_02)".The ML approach (Logistic Regression classification model, Random Forest classification model, and python libraries; Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc) was used to predict titanic shipwreck passenger survivors.          

.Project #3:  This project involves "[Building and Training a regression model](https://github.com/temitopeseun/Projects/tree/main/Project_03)" to predict demands for a business product at any given hour, based on time and weather. In doing this, EDA was conducted, a 2-D map was plotted, train a regression model, regularize model to avoid overfitting, and compute RMSLE for the training and validation set.
