# Projects
Compilation of "Data Science Projects in the last months" 


.Project #1:  This project involves [Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA], Data Visualization, and Visual Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/temitopeseun/Projects/tree/main/Project_01).

.Project #2:  This project involves "[EDA, and solving classification problems using Machine Learning (ML)](https://github.com/temitopeseun/Projects/tree/main/Project_02)".The ML approach (Logistic Regression classification model, Random Forest classification model, and python libraries; Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc) was used to predict titanic shipwreck passenger survivors.          

.Project #3:  This project involves "[Building and Training a regression model](https://github.com/temitopeseun/Projects/tree/main/Project_03)" to predict demands for a business product at any given hour, based on time and weather. In doing this, EDA was conducted, a 2-D map was plotted, train a regression model, regularize model to avoid overfitting, and compute RMSLE for the training and validation set. 

.Project #4 :  This project involves using [ML Algorithim for Text Extraction](https://github.com/temitopeseun/Projects/tree/main/Project_04), Classification and Prediction of Artist. I trained a classification model that predicts the artist. The model also carried out Tokenization, Lemmatization and Text Vectorization.

.Project #5 :  This project is about "[Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/temitopeseun/Projects/tree/main/Project_05)"

.Project #6 :This project is about ["Time series Analysis"](https://github.com/temitopeseun/Projects/tree/main/Project_06) of temperature data as a function of Trend, Seasonality, and Remainder was plotted. Short-term weather prediction using Autoregressive (AR) model and Autoregressive-Integrated-Moving-Average (ARIMA) model , as well as python libraries such as statsmodels among others were deployed.

.Project #7 :This project is about ["Markov Simulation of customer's movement"](https://github.com/temitopeseun/Projects/tree/main/Project_07). Some EDAs were performed for better analysis.
