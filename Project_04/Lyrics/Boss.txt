Ain't nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it, boss
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it), real one
Ain't nothing to it (there's nothing), boss

I pay the cost, who 'gon take it off (take it off)
I record then I ball (then I ball), I ignored a lot of calls (click, click)
You ain't talking about nothing, I ain't got no time
Got that dinero on my mind
Ooh, I got real problems just like you (bitch!)
Tell that bitch, "I don't like you" (I don't f*ck with you!)

Ain't nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it), boss
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it), real one
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it), I boss
Ooh, real one, uh, I'm a boss

(Let me get 'em, Bey) oh yeah
Hundred million crib, three million watch, all facts
No cap, false, nigga, you not a boss, you got a boss
Niggas getting jerked, that shit hurts, I take it personally
Niggas rather work for the man than to work with me
Just so they can pretend they on my level, that shit is irkin' to me
Pride always goeth before the fall, almost certainly
It's disturbing what I gross (what I gross!)
Survey says you not even close (not even close)
Everybody's bosses 'til it's time to pay for the office
'Til them invoices, separate the men from the boys, over here
We measure success by how many people successful next to you
Here we say you broke if everybody else broke except for you
Boss!

Ain't nothing to it, real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it), boss (boss, boss, boss)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it), real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it), a boss
Ooh, real one, I'm a boss, oh, yeah

Ain't nothing to it, I boss so I bought my momma a whip
My great-great-grandchildren already rich
That's a lot of brown chi'r'en on your Forbes list
Probably looking around my compound on my fortress, boss
I be ridin' around with my seat reclining
Droppin' my daughter off at school every morning
We slammin' car doors, I be true balling on these bum boy
You ain't talking about nothing, I ain't got no time, boss
Chill, tell them paps they gotta relax (you tried it!)
Toes in the sand, momma gettin' fat stacks

Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it), real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it), boss (boss)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it), real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it), I boss
Ooh, real one, I'm a boss, oh, yeah

Ooh, ooh, I'm a boss
