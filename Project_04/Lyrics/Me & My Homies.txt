[Chorus]
Me and my homies tho
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

But I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I catch a girl with my phone
And cause some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go

[Chorus: x2]

I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us party
Keep it close to my heart
Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snitches
Nobody come before my niggas, f*ck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other, cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets,
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies
Me and my fucking homies

[Chorus]

(Me and my homies)
Constantly we mash
(Me and my homies)
Gotta make that cash
(Me and my homies)
There's no need to ask
(Me and my homies)
We are still the best

[Repeat: x8]
(that's my homeys)
That's my homeys
D-P-G-C homeys

[Chorus]
