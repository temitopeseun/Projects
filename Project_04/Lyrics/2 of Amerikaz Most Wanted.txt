[Snoop Talking] 
Up out of there 
[Daz, repeated several times until first verse begins] 
Ain't nothin' but A Gangsta Party 

[Tupac Talking] 
Ahh shit 
You've done fucked up now 
You done put two of Amerikaz most wanted in the same muthafuckin' place 
At the same muthafuckin' time 
Ya'll niggas about to feel this 
Break out the Champagne glasses and muthafuckin' condoms 
Have one on us aight 

[Tupac] 
Picture Perfect 
I paint a perfect picture 
Bombin' hooties with percision 
Mind intensions to get with ya 
With the S-N double-O-P dogg 
To help my fuckin' homie 
You's a cold ass nigga on them all 

[Snoop] 
Sure enough I keep my hand on my gun 
Cause they got me on the run 
Now I am back in the court room waitin' on the outcome 
Free Tupac is all that's on a niggas mind 
But at the same time 
It seem they tryin' to take mine 
So I am get smart and get the best of this shit 
And put together a million march plus some gangsta shit 

[Tupac] 
So now they got us laced 
Two multi millionaire muthafuckas catchin' cases 
Bitches get ready for the throw down 
The shits about to go down 
Uhh, me and Snoop about to clown 
I am losin' my religion 
I am vicious on these stool pigeons 
You might be deep in this game 
But you got some rules missin' 
Niggas be actin like we savage 
See I'm a get the cabbage 
I got nutin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish 

[Snoop] 
I got a pet named P she niggarino 
I got a house out in the Hills right next to Chino 
And I think I got a Black Beama' 
But my dream is to own a fly casino 
Like Bugsy Segal, and do it all illegal 
And get scooped up, by the little homie in a Regal 
Uhh it feel good to ya Baby bubba 
You see this is for the G's and the Ki's muthafucka 

[Tupac] 
Now follow as we Ride 
Muthafuck the rest 
Two of the best from the westside 
And I can make you famous 
Niggas been dying for years 
So how could they blame us 
I live in fear of a felony 
I never stop ballin' these 
Mutha fuckin' G's 
If ya got it better flaunt it 
Another warrant 
Two of Amerikaz Most Wanted 

Chorus 
[Daz] 

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (Repeat x2) 
[Tupac] 
Nothin' but a gangsta party 
[Daz] 
Ain't Nothin' but a gangsta Party 
[Tupac] 
Ain't Nothin' but a gangsta Party 
It ain't nothin' but a muthafuckin' gangsta party 
[Daz] 
Ain't Nothin' but a gangsta Party 
[Tupac] 
Ain't Nothin' but a gangsta Party 
It ain't nothin' but a muthafuckin' gangsta party 
[Daz] 
Ain't nothin but a gangsta party 
[Tupac] 
Now give me fifty feet 
The feet is not my destiny 
Release me to the streets 
And keep what evers left of me 
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is grief 
Better be prepared when you cowards f*ck with me I 
I busta free, these niggas must be crazy (What) 
There ain't no mercy mutha fuckas 
Who can fade the thugs? 
You thought it was but it wasn't 
Now disappear 
Bow down in the presence of a Boss playa 

[Snoop] 
It's like 'cause, blood, gang banging 
Everybody in the party doing dope slangin' 
You got to have papers in this world 
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl 
Ya doing ya job 
Every day 
And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray 
Let me tell you about life and 'bout the way it is 
See we live by the gun so we die by the blood of kids 

[Tupac] 
They tell me not to roll with my glock 
So now I got to throw away 
Floating in the black Benz 
Trying to do a show a day 
They wonder how I live with five shots 
Niggas is hard to kill on my block 
Scheme for currency and dough related 
Affilliated with the hustlas 
So we made it 
Your answer to the question 
Tryin' to get up on it 
My nigga dogg homie and two of the most wanted 

Chorus 
[Daz] 

Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party...
