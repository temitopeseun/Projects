I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah

Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah

Yeah, f*ck your subpoenas and your misdemeanors
Was too busy touring out all your arenas
My passport is tatted, it look like it's active
I play on these planes, y'all catch me in traffic
Y'all drag me in court for that shit, y'all backwards
After all these years of drug trafficking, huh
Time to remind me I'm black again, huh?
All this talking back, I'm too arrogant, huh?
What would you do, you knew you couldn't fail
I have no fear of anything, do everything well
I have no fear of jail, I was born in the trap
I have no fear of death, we all born to do that
It's just life, I'm just nice, tonight I might, raise my price
Great advice, damn you, Hov, Jesus Christ

I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah

And I'm nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice
Up all night, night, night, night, night, night, night
Running from the lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights
Covered in ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice

Patiently waiting for my demise
'Cause my success can't be quantified
If I gave two fucks, two fucks about streaming numbers
Would have put Lemonade up on Spotify
F*ck you, f*ck you, you're cool, f*ck you, I'm out (ah!)
I ain't never seen a ceiling in my whole life, that's word to Blue
Freestyling live, blueprint from my Jigga who never bribes
I'm so nice, I'm everybody type, goddamn right
I'm so nice, Jesus Christ, I'm better than the hype, I give you life

I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah

And I'm nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice
Up all night, night, night, night, night, night, night
Running from the lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights
Covered in ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice

Last name 'gon be here forever
Now we finna float like feathers
Me and Hova do it like rebels
Most of y'all jits got pebbles
I got the Rock in the Fellar
Ice lightning bolts from the Heavens
Y'all 'gon have to watch us eat

Stocked up like the doomsday preppers
Anybody ever had an era, when things could've been better
Feeling like you was on a stretcher
And all you remember was the Hecklers
But the Universe lifts that weight
Then you shine like a new feather, blessings on blessings, et cetra
Feeling like the best year ever, damn, it's nice

I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah

And I'm nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice
Up all night, night, night, night, night, night, night
Running from the lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights
Covered in ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice
