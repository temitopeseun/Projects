Who the f*** you think you're f***in' with? I'm the f***in' boss
Seven forty-five, white on white that's f***in' Ross
I cut 'em wide, I cut 'em long, I cut 'em fat
I keep 'em comin' back, we keep 'em comin' back

I'm in the distribution, I'm like Atlantic
I got them motherf***ers flyin' 'cross the Atlantic
I know Pablo Noriega, the real Noriega
He owe me a hundred favors

I ain't petty n****, we buy the whole thang
See most of my n****s really still deal cocaine
My roof back, my money rides
I'm on the pedal, show you what I'm runnin' like

When they snatch black, I cry for a hundred nights
He got a hundred bodies, servin' a hundred lifes

We never steal cars, but we deal hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
I caught a charge
(You caught a charge?)

(Yea?)
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard

Ain't bout no funny s***, still b****es and business
I'm on my money s*** still whippin' them Benzes
Major league who catchin'? Because I'm pitchin'
Jose Canseco just snitchin' because he's finish

I feed 'em steroids to strengthen up all my chickens
They flyin' over Pacifics to be specific
Triple see's, you know it's back, we holdin' sacks
So n**** go on rat, run and tell 'em that
Mo' cars, mo' hoes, mo' clothes, mo blows

It's time to spend my thrills, custom spinnin' wheels
I ain't drove in a week them b****es spinnin' still
Talk about me ?cause these suckers scared to talk about me
Killers chalkin' bout me, it ain't no talk about me

It ain't no walkin' 'round me, see all these killers 'round me
Lot of drug dealin' 'round me goin' down in Dade County

Don't tote no twenty-twos, Magnum cost me twenty-two
Sat it on them twenty-twos, birds go for twenty-two
Lil' mama super thick, she say she twenty-two
She seen them twenty-twos, we in room two twenty-two

I touch work like I'm convertible Burt

In the M-I-A yo! Them n****z rich off that yayo
Steady slangin' yayo, my Chevy bangin' aiyyo
